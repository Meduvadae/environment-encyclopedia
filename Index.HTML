    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a non-linear "Digital Apothecary." The main view is a filterable grid of plant cards, allowing users to either browse all plants or narrow the selection by medicinal property or conservation status. This task-oriented approach prioritizes user discovery over the report's linear format. Clicking a card opens a modal with tabbed content (Description, Benefits, Safety, etc.), keeping the user in a single context and preventing a long, un-scannable page. This structure is chosen for its superior usability, encouraging exploration and comparison rather than passive reading. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. **Conservation Status Overview (Report Info: Conservation status for each plant) -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Provides an immediate, high-level comparison of the ecological status of all plants, a key theme in the report. -> Library: Chart.js/Canvas.** 2. **Medicinal Properties Profile (Report Info: List of benefits for each plant) -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> Viz: Radar Chart (in detail modal) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Creates a unique "fingerprint" for each plant, allowing for quick visual assessment of its primary therapeutic strengths (e.g., strong in 'anti-inflammatory', moderate in 'cognitive'). -> Library: Chart.js/Canvas.** 3. **Interactive Grid (Report Info: All plant data) -> Goal: Organize/Filter -> Presentation: HTML/CSS Cards + JS Filtering -> Interaction: Click filters to show/hide cards -> Justification: The core interactive element, enabling users to query the dataset based on their specific interests (e.g., "show me all adaptogens").** CONFIRMED NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
